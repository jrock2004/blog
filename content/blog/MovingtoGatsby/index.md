# What I Used Before

For the longest time I have been using [Empress Blog](https://empress-blog.netlify.app) as my blogging framework. This framework is built using [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com), which is an awesome JS framework. There were lots of issues with 3rd party dependencies that was making it hard to maintain.

# Gatsby

So I decided to go hunt and see what other options that I could use. I always wanted to play around with GraphQL and React. Lots of resources brought me to Gatsby. I will have a future blog post showing it off.

# Design

I started working on how this is going to look, for now I have something simple but will work on something better. Design is always hard for me.
