So I was looking at what I was paying for Wordpress and just felt I could save some money.

[The old blog](https://jcwebconcepts.wordpress.com/) will still exist, I just will not put any content on there. Now I only pay for the domain name cost and the host is free. I am not that popular so I think having a smaller setup is better.
